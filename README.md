# Generative Adversarial Networks
## Team Members
Szu Kai Yang, Nidhi Sakhala
## Goals
Our goal is to recreate a GAN application. We are still in the process of chosing which application to work on. Some of the applications that we found interesting are CycleGAN, Super Resolution and Face Aging.
## Challenges
We might have computation issues since we will be training more than one network.
